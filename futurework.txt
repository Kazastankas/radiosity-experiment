Future Work:

	
Textures & Smoothing
	Due to the nature of the radiosity algorithm, it is generally infeasible to compute radiosity per-pixel
	(and indeed, without knowing the camera position ahead of time, this is truly impossible).
	As a compromise, we subdivide all surfaces in the scene into small patches and compute energy transfer per patch.
	One improvement we plan to make on this strategy is to store radiosity information to textures and blur each of these textures to create a smooth result.

Multiple Cameras
	In order to evaluate the benefits one could get from computing radiosity on the cloud, we will implement
	a second (and possibly third or fourth) camera.  This will help showcase the view-independent nature of the calculation.

Dynamic Scenes
	With a static scene, it is unneccesary to recompute radiosity per-frame.  Instead, we can precompute radiosity and continue to use a stored result.
	We will generalize this to scenes with moving light-sources and recompute as necessary.
